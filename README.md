# Machine-Intelligence-CMPE67701.2231-

The project was done by maintaining the following steps:

## Preprocessing Section: 
The dataset originally (__[Train.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16DKMe3Bq2uRvn6M40NSd-tUKJefOpjbh/view?usp=drive_link)__) had 81 Features. This was reduced to 55 by removing columns that had data less than 90% or 90% single unique value. We considered them as not having significant effects on the dataset. The updated dataset after this stage is (__[Train_update.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2UApME1NSnVvwEFezFv1KaDJ-SdX8RP/view?usp=sharing)__). The list of removed Features in this stage is (__[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16upVq-TGGOqD9Xdib0i-qCiwL3MfOgvR/view?usp=drive_link)__).
